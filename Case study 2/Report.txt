-Small h has smooth curve matching theoretical solution
-Large h is has more oscillations, overshoot, and alot of instability
3.
τ determines the circuit's response speed to voltage changes. 
It's the natural time scale for the RC circuit's transient behavior

-Capacitator blocks DC current but pass voltage
-Inductor block voltage charge but pass DC current
-Shows opposite behaviour:
*Capacitor voltage follows input, current goes to zero
*Inductor current follows input, voltage goes to zero
-At steady state current:
Capacitor: 0.000 A (acts like an open circuit)
The current starts high during charging but decays exponentially to zero
Once fully charged, no current flows through the capacitor
Inductor: 0.010 A (acts like a short circuit)
The current starts at zero and builds up exponentially to I = V/R = 1V/100Ω = 0.010 A
Once in steady state, current flows freely through the inductor

Three oscillation regimes by varying R:
Large R: Quick decay (overdamped)
Medium R: Tuned oscillation (critically damped)
Small R: Numerical instability/growing oscillations
